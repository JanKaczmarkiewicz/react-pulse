## Introduction

The problem with client-side react rendering is that it is slow. User have to wait for:

- javascript code to load and run in the browser to render
- request for data/content to be fullfilled

to view content on the page.

React server-side rendering is a technique that allows you to show content of the page without javascript is loaded.
